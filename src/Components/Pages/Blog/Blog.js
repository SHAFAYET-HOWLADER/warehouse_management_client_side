                                Node. js is a rapidly growing technology that has been overtaking the world of server-side programming with surprising speed. MongoDB is a technology that's revolutionizing database usage. Together, the two tools are a potent combination, thanks to the fact that they both employ JavaScript and JSON

                                MongoDB and NodeJS are two different technologies. MonogDB is a database system which gives you a chance to efficiently store documents in a database and to perform operations like data updates, or to search documents by some criterias.
                                <br />

                                <br/>
                                Nodejs is a Javascript engine that you can write any application you want with (by programming in the Javascript language). It runs your Javascript code. Most commonly, it is used to build servers that can respond to web requests, though it can be used for lots of other types of code too.

                                There are a lot of databases used today in the industry. Some are SQL databases, some are NoSQL databases. The conventional database is SQL database system that uses tabular relational model to represent data and their relationship. The NoSQL database is the newer one database that provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data other than tabular relations model used in relational databases.

                                1.Databases are categorized as Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
                                <br />

                                2.	SQL databases have fixed or static or predefined schema.
                                <br />

                                3.SQL databases use a powerful language "Structured Query Language" to define and manipulate the data.
                                <br />
                                <br />

                                1.NoSQL databases are categorized as Non-relational or
                                distributed database system.
                                <br />

                                2.NoSQL databases have dynamic schema.
                                <br />

                                3.NoSQL databases display data as collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores.

                                First, some termes dâ€™art need to be disambiguated. Itâ€™s not uncommon to hear somebody refer to a REST API as simply an API. Likewise, we frequently see JWTs conflated with the pattern of JWT-based authentication. JWT on its own is nothing but an open standard (RFC 7519) for transmitting messages via HTTP. JWT as a standard can be used for any message at all. It has one characteristic in particular that makes it a good tool for sending a userâ€™s identity to a backend service. We can trust the integrity of a JWT because JWTs are signed, making them tamper-proof.

                                1.Section one is the header. This section contains JWT metadata; typically information about the type of token and the algorithm used to sign it. It is encoded JSON.
                                <br />
                                2.Section two is the payload. This is the content of the token and is also encoded JSON.

                                3.Section three is the signature. This is the SHA256 (or some other HMAC) hash of the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret. This part of the JWT is used to verify the integrity of the message.
